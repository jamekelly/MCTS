## How to play
You go second
When it is your turn, click on the black checker you would like to move and enter the move in the text box. "r" will move the piece to your right, "l" to the left. "kr" and "kl" are used when the piece is a king and you want to move in the opposite direction.
Pieces will score if possible.
